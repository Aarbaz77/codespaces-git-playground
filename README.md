## Creating a repository from a template

Follow this [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) to create a repository from this template.

After creating a project from this template, update the [line](#codespace-quickstart-using-template) markdown replacing `juancarlosjr97/codespaces-git-playground` with the path of the project created. It will be a combination of the GitHub username joined with the name of the GitHub repository as `${GITHUB_USERNAME}/${GITHUB_REPOSITORY}`.

## Developing in Codespace

When a Codespace is created comes with Git with credentials of the GitHub account setup ready for development, and basic tools ready for development such as `python`. For more information, read the official [GitHub Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-a-codespace/developing-in-a-codespace).
